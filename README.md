You will need the Unity Editor to inspect and build my project.

Unity is licensed software.
This means that while I have included an installation of the Unity Editor,
you will have to create an free account with which to generate a free license.

This project has been written in and for Windows 10.

===LOADING THE PROJECT===
With the Unity Editor open, click File>Open Project
Select the Block Fighters folder.
Upon loading the project, a popup may prompt you to install the newest version.
If so, click "Skip new version".

===BUILDING FROM EDITOR===
File>Build Settings>Build or optionally Build And Run.

===RUNNING EXECUTABLE (DOES NOT REQUIRE THE UNITY EDITOR)===
Run Block Fighters Executable/Block Fighters.exe
It will ask for firewall permissions, click cancel.
