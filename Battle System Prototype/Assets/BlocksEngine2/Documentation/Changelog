v2.0
- Major Upgrade
- Full redesign and code

v2.1
# Needed action to update from v2.0: Remove the "Scripts/EngineCore/Core" folder before importing the new version

- moved blocks LayoutUpdate from Update to LateUpdate to avoid glitch on resizing 
- "Type" property of the I_BE2_Block made settable to fix and facilitate build of custom blocks
- detection of spot on drag of Block moved to coroutine and performed on end of frame to avoid glith on detecting new spot
- blocksStack array of the ExecutionManager made public
- BE2_EventsManager refactored to enable event types that pass I_BE2_Block when triggered
- previous BE2EtenvTypes misspell fixed to BE2EventTypes
- added new event types: OnBlocksStackArrayUpdate, OnStackExecutionStart, OnStackExecutionEnd
- Loops are now executed "in frame" instead of mandatorily "in update". Faster loop execution and nested loops without delay
- BE2_Text class added to enable the use of either Text or Text Mesh Pro (TMP) component to display text in the Blocks.
- bugfix: fixed detection of spots between child blocks before first block is dropped 
- bugfix: fixed destroying operations placed as inputs causing error 
- bugfix: fixed assigned wrong Type when building Loop Blocks
- bugfix: fixed variable blocks not updating dropdown when new variables were crated
